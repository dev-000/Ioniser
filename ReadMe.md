# Build an Ioniser in under $10

This repo contains all the hardware files needed to build a low cost ioniser. It helps in settling dust particles around the device, effectively "cleansing" the air in the room.  Repo also contains the simulation files if you want to check the theoretical output voltages.

Details and circuit explanations are mentioned in the link below. Please do read the links fully before starting the build process.

Repo contains files for both Positive and Negative Ioniser which gives you a High Voltage positive and negative DC voltages. The circuits are very similar except that the diodes are swapped. Bill of Materials remains same for both versions. 

You can upload the *Gerbers.zip* file directly on to any online PCB manufacturing shop to get it made or edit the Eagle schematic and layout files to your liking.   

Please be very careful dealing with AC voltages and High voltage DC outputs. Capacitors do retain charge for sometime and you will get a zap if you touch them.
